# Objective: Given a string input and a dictionary of words, if the word is entirely
# composed of words from the dictionary, return a space-separated string of words;
# Otherwise, return nil. Use dynamic programming to arrive at the solution.

def word_break(str, dict)

end

foo = ["foo", "bar", "boo", "cat"]
p word_break "foobar", foo

# Time Complexity: O(n ** 2)
